## 1. Does the cortisol level return to normal 30 hours after being stimulated?

### **Source**:
**Huber et al., 2003**: (ACTH represents adrenocorticotropic hormone)  
"ACTH injection resulted in a significant increase in faecal cortisol metabolite levels, with a peak occurring 18–20 hours post-injection. Levels gradually returned to baseline values within approximately 24–36 hours."

### **Answer**:
The articles do not specifically mention a 30-hour time point. However, based on the description of "approximately 24–36 hours," it seems reasonable to assume that cortisol levels may return to normal around 30 hours after stimulation.

## 2. The mechanism of cortisol level elevation:

### **Source**:
**Palme, 2019**:  
"Glucocorticoids orchestrate the physiological stress response by mobilizing energy, suppressing immune reactions, and facilitating adaptation to the stressor. Their release is regulated by the HPA axis through a negative feedback loop."

**Möstl & Palme, 2002**:  
"The activation of the HPA axis is a key response to stress, leading to the release of CRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the pituitary to secrete ACTH. ACTH then acts on the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as cortisol."  

"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the central system mediating stress responses. Upon stress exposure, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus, triggering the release of ACTH from the pituitary, which then stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids. These hormones help the body adapt to stress by increasing glucose availability, altering immune responses, and influencing behavior."

**Huber et al., 2003**:  
"Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to the release of CRH from the hypothalamus. CRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to release ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids, primarily cortisol in most mammals. This process helps the organism cope with stress by mobilizing energy reserves and regulating immune responses."

"The release of glucocorticoids during stress is part of a highly conserved adaptive mechanism. ACTH secreted by the pituitary directly stimulates the adrenal cortex, resulting in cortisol release. Cortisol plays a pivotal role in maintaining energy balance, suppressing non-essential functions, and preparing the organism for a 'fight-or-flight' response."

### **Answer**:
These three articles highlight the core mechanisms underlying stress responses:
1. **Activation of the HPA axis**: Stress triggers the hypothalamus to release CRH, which prompts the pituitary gland to produce ACTH. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol.
2. **Adaptive roles of cortisol**:  
   - Mobilizing energy reserves by increasing blood glucose levels.  
   - Suppressing non-essential functions such as immune activity and digestion.  
   - Enhancing physiological preparedness for "fight-or-flight" situations.
