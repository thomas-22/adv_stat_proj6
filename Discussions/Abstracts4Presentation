# Physiological Mechanisms of Stress Response and Non-Invasive Monitoring

## 1. Physiological Mechanisms of Stress Response
**Source**: Möstl & Palme, 2002

- The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) is the central system mediating stress responses. The paper describes:
  > "The activation of the HPA axis is a key response to stress, leading to the release of CRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the pituitary to secrete ACTH. ACTH then acts on the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as cortisol."
- Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FCM) were proposed as a non-invasive indicator of stress response:
  > "Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites provide a measure of HPA activity delayed by the gut passage time, which averages 24 hours in most mammals."

## 2. Faecal Sample Study on Red Deer
**Source**: Huber et al., 2003

- The study induced stress responses in red deer via ACTH injections and tracked the dynamics of FCM concentrations. The paper states:
  > "ACTH injection resulted in a significant increase in faecal cortisol metabolite levels, with a peak occurring 18–20 hours post-injection. Levels gradually returned to baseline values within approximately 24–36 hours."
- It confirmed the validity of faecal samples for monitoring stress:
  > "This process confirms the suitability of faecal samples for monitoring adrenocortical activity, provided that the time delay due to gut passage is considered."

## 3. Challenges and Advances in Non-Invasive Monitoring
**Source**: Palme, 2019

- The key challenge of non-invasive monitoring lies in the influence of metabolic and environmental factors:
  > "Glucocorticoids orchestrate the physiological stress response by mobilizing energy, suppressing immune reactions, and facilitating adaptation to the stressor. Their release is regulated by the HPA axis through a negative feedback loop."
- The paper highlights the time delay and environmental effects on faecal hormone measurements:
  > "Faecal cortisol/corticosterone metabolite concentrations reflect HPA axis activity, but with a time lag that corresponds to the gut passage time, which ranges from 16–48 hours depending on the species."
- On technological advances:
  > "Recent advances, such as high-performance liquid chromatography, allow for better accuracy and reliability in faecal hormone analysis."
