# Uncertainties in the Study

### 1. Hunting Event Timing
The recorded time is a single point, making it unclear whether it marks the start, middle, or end of the event. This limits understanding of its duration.

### 2. Location Accuracy
Hunting locations might not always be precise, especially in remote areas.

### 3. Event Overlap
Hunting events close in time or space may be hard to separate, complicating their individual impacts on FCM levels.

### 4. Lag Time Assumption
The assumed 19-hour lag for FCM response may vary across individuals or conditions, leading to potential mismatches.

### 5. Individual Differences
Variations in age, health, or temperament among deer arenâ€™t accounted for, which could affect results.

### 6. Other Stressors
Factors like predators or weather may influence FCM levels, making it harder to isolate the effect of hunting.

### 7. Data Gaps
Missing timestamps or incomplete data could affect the accuracy of the analysis.
