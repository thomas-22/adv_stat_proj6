# Definition of Relevant Hunting Events

We consider two types of "relevant hunting events".

**Type 1:**

Suppose that an FCM sample is taken today from a deer.

- A hunting event is time-relvant, if it happened yesterday or the day before yesterday.
- A hunting event is space-relevant, if, on the day of the hunting event, the average distance between the deer and the hunting event was <= 3 km.

A hunting event is relevant, if it is both time- and -space relevant.

**Type 2:**

Suppose that an FCM sample is taken. The defecation time is known.

- A hunting event is time-relevant, if it happened within 16 and 30 hours prior to defecation.
- A hunting event is space-relevant, if, at the time of the hunting event, the deer was no more than 3 km away from the hunting event.
