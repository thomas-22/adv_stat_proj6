<!-- ## The Goal

assess red deer **stress response towards hunting activities**

-- on 41 individual **collared red deer**

-- within *Bavarian Forest National Park*

-- using **FCMs**

## The Terminology

-   **FCMs**: Faecal Cortisol Metabolites - a non-invasive method to measure stress through faecal samples

-   **collared deer**: red deer wearing a GPS-collar, which provides hourly location information

Baisu: I don't think we need to introduce the Euclidean distance.
-   **Euclidean Distance**: Also known as $L^2$ Distance. Reduces to Pythagorean Theorem for two Dimensions: $$d_{x,y} = ((x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2)^\frac{1}{2} \\ x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2 $$ -->
```

## Motivation

-   **Faecal Cortisol Metabolites (FCM)** are substances collected from feces of animals.
-   FCM level \[ng/g\] is a measure of stress level. Higher FCM level $\implies$ higher stress.
-   Stress $\Rightarrow$ secretion of certain hormones $\Rightarrow$ gut retention $\Rightarrow$ FCM.
-   Hunting activities might induce stress for red deer, even if non-lethal.
-   Goal: analyze how the distance in space and time to the (last) hunting event affects the FCM level.

<!-- Putting "last" in parentheses, because it is mentioned in the project description, but we know only looking at the last hunting event is not good enough. (We have "nearest" and "score" as well.) -->

## FCM Level and Gut Retention Time

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   FCM level does not represent stress level when defecating.
-   Gut retention time $\approx$ 19 hours.

## The Approach

-   model FCM levels on spatial and temporal distance to hunting activities

-   Expectation: FCM levels higher when closer in time and space

## The Data-Generating Process {.smaller}

-   A deer roams freely in the forest. Its movement is tracked by a GPS collar.
-   A hunting event happens.
-   After some time, the deer defecates. This is a **defecation event**.
-   After some time, researchers go to the defecation location and collect an FCM sample.

Note: The defecation location is not the deer's location at the time of the stress event.

## The Datasets {.smaller}

-   **Movement**: contains the location and datetime of the **41** collared deer in the period Feb 2020 - Feb 2023 in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Movement is tracked at **hourly** intervals.

-   **Hunting Events**: contains location and date of hunting events in the Bavarian Forest National Park - in total 1270 events, **890 of them with full timestamp**.

-   **FCM Stress**: contains information of **809 faecal samples**, including

    -   the FCM level \[ng/g\],
    -   the time and location of sampling,
    -   to which deer the sample belongs,
    -   when defecation happened.

-   **Reproduction Success**: contains information about of **16** collared deer about

    -   if they were pregnant in one year,
    -   if they were accompanied by a calf in one year.

## Distance Approximation via Interpolation

TBD: Illustration.

## Relevant Hunting Events {.smaller}

We introduce **4 parameters**:

-   **Gut retention time (GRT) low** \[hours\],
-   **Gut retention time (GRT) high** \[hours\],
-   **Distance threshold** \[km\],
-   **Proximity criterion** ("last", "nearest", or "highest score")

A hunting event is considered **relevant** to an FCM sample, if

-   the time difference between experiencing stress (hunting) and defecation is between the GRT thresholds, and
-   the distance between the deer and the hunting event is $\leq$ distance threshold.

## The Most Relevant Hunting Event {.smaller}

Among the relevant hunting events, the **most relevant** one is defined by the proximity criterion:

-   the closest in time ("last"),
-   the closest in space ("nearest"), or
-   the one with the "highest score."

The scoring function is defined as TBD.

data <- readRDS("Data/Datasets.RDS")

knitr::kable(data,

             align = c("r", "r", "r", "r", "r", "r"),

## The Models {.smaller}

For Modelling, we consider the following covariates, defined for each pair of FCM sample and most relevant hunting event:

-   [**Time difference** \[hours\]]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}
-   [**Distance** \[km\]]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}
-   [**Sample delay** \[hours\]]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}
-   [Pregnant]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}
-   [Defecation day (between 1 and 366)]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}
-   [Number of other relevant hunting events]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

## The Models {.smaller}

-   Generalized additive mixed model with Gamma family and log link.

-   Let $i = 1,\dots,N$ be the indices of deer and $j = 1,\dots,n_i$ be the indices of FCM measurements for each deer.
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\textup{FCM}_{ij} &\sim& \mathcal{Ga}\left( \nu, \frac{\nu}{\mu_{ij}} \right) \\
\mu_{ij} &=& \mathbb{E}(\textup{FCM}_{ij}) = \exp(\eta_{ij}) \\
\eta_{ij} &=& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textup{Pregnant}_{ij} + \beta_2 \textup{NumberOtherHunts}_{ij} + \\
&& f_1(\textup{TimeDiff}_{ij}) + f_2(\textup{Distance}_{ij}) + \\
&& f_3(\textup{SampleDelay}_{ij}) + f_4(\textup{DefecationDay}_{ij}) + \\
&& \gamma_{i}, \\
\gamma_i &\sim& \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\gamma^2).
\end{eqnarray}
$$
-   $f_1, \dots, f_4$ are penalized cubic regression splines.
<!-- We do not use cyclic splines for defecation day, because we have no observations in winter. The start and end of the spline does not connect. -->

## Results on Dataset "Latest" {.smaller}

```{r}
#| results: asis
library(itsadug)
m_L <- readRDS("Models/m_L.RDS")
gamtabs(m_L, caption = "GAM summary on dataset \"latest\".", type = "html")
```

## Results on Dataset "Latest"

Large uncertainty, no visible time effect

```{r}
p_L <- readRDS("Figures/p_L.RDS")
print(p_L)

## Conclusion

-   Not many observations after datafusion left for robust modelling

-   Trade-off between spatial and temporal distance

-   Sample Delay seems to be significant

-   Modelling Outcomes don't show much difference

-   Trade-off between Complexity and Explainability

## Discussion

-   How to minimize spatial and temporal distance at the same time?

-   How to use a bigger Part of the Data?
