# Summary

# Introduction
## Background
Hunting activities have long been recognized to have a numerical effect on animal populations
through individuals removal. 

More recently a larger focus was brought on the non-lethal effect
hunting can have through behaviour change (e.g., space use, vigilance or fleeing behaviour).


Numerous studies highlight such process, however, little is known about the physiological
response preceeding and driving the behaviour changes in wildlife. 

A measurement of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) as a non-invasive, physiological parameter reflecting
hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity is a growing method to assess stress
response towards stimulus. 

In this project, we aim to assess red deer short-term stress response
towards hunting events at the Bavarian Forest National Park, using FCMs methods, and test the
effect of spatial and temporal distances on this response. We expect the FCM to be higher when
being closer in space and time to a hunting event.

## Data Generating Process
-   Hunting activities have a numerical effect on animal populations
-   Additionally, hunting can have non-lethal effects
-   **Goal**: assess short-term stress response in red deer towards hunting events at the Bavarian Forest National Park

-   A deer roams freely in the Bavarian Forest National Park
-   Its **movement is tracked** by a GPS collar
-   A **hunting event** happens
-   After some time, the deer defecates. The **defecation event**
-   Subsequently, Researchers go to the defecation location and collect a **faecal sample**

@Huber2003 showed the following:

## Research Question
-   What is the effect of temporal and spatial distance on FCM levels?
-   Does the time between defecation event and sample collection affect FCM levels?

-   Model FCM levels on spatial and temporal distance to hunting activities

-   **Expectations**:
    -   FCM levels higher when closer in time and space
    -   FCM levels lower, the more time passes between defecating and sampling

# Data Analysis
We were provided with different three Datasets:

  i) Data containing information about the various hunting events
  ii) Data concerning the location of the collared deer over time
  iii) Data about the faecal samples, collected by the researchers

In the following three subchapters we are going to describe the main features of each data set and address any anomalies.

## Hunting Events
-   Contains location and time of $\geq$ 700 hunting events from 2020 to 2022.
-   **519** hunting events have complete location and time information.

## Movement Data
-   Contains the location of the **40** collared deer from Feb. 2020 to Feb. 2023.
-   Movement is tracked at **hourly** intervals.

## Faecal Sample Data
Contains information of **809 faecal samples**, including:
-   the FCM level \[ng/g\],
-   the time and location of sampling,
-   to which deer the sample belongs,
-   when the defecation happened.
Samples where taken at irregular time intervals from 2020 to 2022.
