# Summary

# Introduction

## Background
Apart from the change in populations size, the effects of hunting on wildlife have so far been studied mainly on the basis of behavioral changes. This project aims to investigate the physiological stress response in red deer using non-invasive methods such as the measurement of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs). Stress is expected to be higher in proximity to hunting events.

## Data Generating Process

![Bavarian Forest National Park](Figures/Maps/overview.png)

-   A deer roams freely in the Bavarian Forest National Park

-   Its **movement is tracked** by a GPS collar

-   A **hunting event** happens

-   After some time, the deer defecates. The **defecation event**

-   Subsequently, Researchers go to the defecation location and collect
    a **faecal sample**

@Huber2003 showed the following:

## Research Question
-   **Goal**: assess short-term stress response in red deer towards
    hunting events at the Bavarian Forest National Park

-   What is the effect of temporal and spatial distance on FCM levels?

-   Does the time between defecation event and sample collection affect
    FCM levels?

-   Model FCM levels on spatial and temporal distance to hunting
    activities

-   **Expectations**:

    -   FCM levels higher when closer in time and space
    -   FCM levels lower, the more time passes between defecating and
        sampling

# Data Analysis

We were provided with four distinct Datasets.\ 
In the following subchapters we are going to describe the main
features of each data set, but the reproduction data (see @sec-outlook) and address any anomalies.

## Hunting Events

```{r include=FALSE}
# source("R/DataAnalysis.R")
# plot.hunt.events(save = TRUE)
```

The dataset contains the location and time of roughly 700 individual
hunting events, spanning from 2020 to 2022. There are three main
challenges:

![Hunts - completeness of timestamp](Figures/hunts_incomplete_timestamp.png){#fig-timestamp}

i)  Just a little over 500 of these events have a complete timestamp,
    consisting of date and time of day (@fig-timestamp).
ii) The events are not represented as a period of time, but as a as a single moment in time. Additionally,
as shown in @fig-hunt_dates, there appears to be seasonality in the occurrence of hunts.
iii) Similiarly to ii), the events are only associated with a single spatial
     point. The locations of the events with complete timestamps are illustrated in @fig-hunt_locations.

![Hunts - Locations](Figures/Maps/Hunts_notitle.png){#fig-hunt_locations}

## Movement Data
There are **40 collared deers** which movements have been tracked completely or partially between February 2020 and February 2023. Some collars stopped working before the end-date, some deers got collared *within* the timespan of interest. The location of each individual deer is **tracked on an hourly basis**. The Movement of four randomly selected deer is visualised in @fig-deers_locations. During the winter months, the deers roam in one of four enclosures within the national park.

## Faecal Sample Data
The faecal sample dataset contains information on **809 faecal samples**. Most importantly, the FCM-level (in nanograms per gram [ng/g]), the location of the sample, as shown in @fig-samples_locations, the associated collared deer, the approximate time of defecation and the time of sampling. The samples were taken at irregular intervals, but with obvious seasonality (see @fig-samples_daily_count) from 2020 to 2022.

# Conclusion & Outlook {#sec-outlook}
We deliberately chose not to include the pregnancy data in our model as it only contains information on some deer. As we are not able to label the remainder of the deer as “pregnant”/“not pregnant”, we are convinced that including this information would lead to a huge bias. However, we are strongly in favor of adding additional characteristics that could explain a shift in baseline stress levels.
